### MusicAnalysisUsingPostgreSQL

**Project Overview** - 

This project showcases my SQL skills by solving business questions of varying difficulty using a music store dataset. The dataset includes details such as artist names, rock band names, popular music genres by country, and album purchase statistics.
I categorized the queries depending on the three levels of business questions that is Easy, Moderate, and Hard, reflecting the complexity and depth of analysis.
