# Music Analysis Using PostgreSQL

## 1. Project Overview-  

This project showcases my SQL skills by solving business questions of varying difficulty using a music store dataset. The dataset includes details such as artist names, rock band names, popular music genres by country, and album purchase statistics.
I categorized the queries depending on the three levels of business questions that is Easy, Moderate, and Hard, reflecting the complexity and depth of analysis.

## 2. Dataset Description-

The dataset contains many tables and attributes. Some of the tables have been presented below.

**Artist -**  Name of individual artist

**Albums -** Details of music albums including the amount and country.

**Genres -** Popular music genres.

**Sales -** Purchase records for each album, including the amount and country.

## 3. Business Questions and Query Levels-

**3.1 Easy**

Basic insights requiring simple SQL operations:

**Top-selling artist:** Find the artist with the highest album sales.

**Most popular genre globally:** Identify the genre with the highest purchases across all countries.

**Example Query for Easy Questions**

**3.2 Moderate**

Intermediate questions requiring joins and grouping:

**Country-specific popularity:** Determine the most popular music genre in each country.

**High-value customers:** List customers with the highest total purchases.

**Example Query for Moderate question**

**3.3 Hard**

Advanced insights using subqueries and complex joins:

**Genre influence on sales:** Analyze if certain genres dominate purchases in specific regions.

**Revenue trends:** Identify the yearly revenue growth for each artist.

**Example Query for Tough question**

## 4. Approach-

**Understanding the Schema:** Analyzed the relationships between tables.

**Categorizing Questions:** Grouped questions into three difficulty levels.

**Query Writing:** Designed efficient SQL queries to answer each question.

**Result Interpretation:** Extracted meaningful business insights.



## 5. Tools Used-

**PostgreSQL:** For executing complex SQL queries.

**PgAdmin 4:** For database exploration and management.

**Microsoft Excel:** For data exploration and visualizations.



## 6. Conclusion-

This project highlights how SQL can uncover valuable insights from datasets, aiding strategic decisions in the music industry. The use of PostgreSQL, PgAdmin 4, and Excel demonstrates a versatile approach to data analysis.
